You are given two files invoice.txt and suppliernames.txt. The first file ( invoice.txt ) contains the words of an invoice (see invoice.pdf) generated by the OCR engine. Each line has the text of the word and information about the location of the word in the document. The requirement is to find the supplier name of that invoice by matching the given list of supplier names to the invoice.
